Description: Modular package for generation of sets of ranges
    representing the null hypothesis. These can take the form
    of bootstrap samples of ranges (using the block bootstrap
    framework of Bickel et al 2010), or set of control ranges
    that are matched across one or more covariates. nullranges
    is designed to be inter-operable with other packages for
    analysis of genomic overlap enrichment, including the
    plyranges Bioconductor package.
