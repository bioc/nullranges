# Generation of null ranges via bootstrapping or covariate matching

Modular package for generation of sets of ranges
representing the null hypothesis. These can take the form
of bootstrap samples of ranges (using the block bootstrap
framework of Bickel et al 2010), or set of control ranges
that are matched across one or more covariates. nullranges
is designed to be inter-operable with other packages for
analysis of genomic overlap enrichment, including the
plyranges Bioconductor package.
